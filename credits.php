				<h1>Credits</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Here, we give thanks to all the Parukians who contributed to the main website in one way or another. None of this would have been possible without the help of Parukia's community, as everything on Parukia is created by all of us from scratch. We greatly appreciate all contrubtions, big or small, that are made to help Parukia. However, every extremely large contribution is recorded here for everyone to see, as well as everyone who helped to build Parukia.Net. The following is a list of all contributors and their contributions for Parukia.Net.</p>
